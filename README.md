# c-argpasre: minimalistic source only argparser 

Sometimes you just need an easy way to parse your arguments without the need of
adding a whole dependency to your project. 
This repo offers only a source file and an header you can integrate in your 
build to have minimalistic argparsing for your c cli without any bloat.
(I often need this and I am tiread of constantly rewriting it.)
